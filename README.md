1. API

Requirements:
nodejs and express needs to be installed

Runtime:
launch the file main.js by the following instruction
> node main.js

Then, we can check the GET request using POSTMAN.
The input is in the form "localhost:8081/api/id/lim"

Here, id = Subreddit tag, lim = number of posts returned

2. Web app

This is not a proper app but an interactive page to see the JSON object

Requirements:
nodejs and express needs to be installed

Runtime:
launch the file main.js by the following instruction
> node server.js

open index.htm in a browser

Fill the form and click submit. It will direct you to a page with JSON object printed.
